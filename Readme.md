# Rich Text Editor for WPF - Replace Standard Command with Custom Command

This example illustrates the technique used to modify the functionality of existing DXRichEdit commands.

## Implementation Details

The RichEditControl exposes the [IRichEditCommandFactoryService](https://docs.devexpress.com/OfficeFileAPI/DevExpress.XtraRichEdit.Services.IRichEditCommandFactoryService) interface that enables you to substitute the default command with a custom command.

1. Create a command class, inherited from the command that you've decided to replace. Override its methods. The main functionality and command specifics is located in the [Execute](https://docs.devexpress.com/CoreLibraries/DevExpress.Utils.Commands.Command.Execute) or the `ExecuteCore` method (the latter does not check for the command availability).

2. Create a class that implements the `IRichEditCommandFactoryService`. Override the `CreateCommand` method to create an instance of a custom command class if an identifier of a certain command is passed as a parameter. 

3. Use this class to substitute the default RichEditControl's service.
